<p>Reading paper sentence by sentence means to me normally low-effciency, expecially when you don&rsquo;t get the ideas yet but try to understand the section with lots of details.</p>

<p>Therefore I read a paper from S.keshav, &ldquo;How to Read a Paper&rdquo; to learn how to read a paper.</p>

<p>This blog is my own words summarize the key points of the paper.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This artical introduces a 3-step methods to read a paper, to improve the efficiency. And it can also be used for doing a literature survey.</p>

<h2 id="three-pass-approch">Three-Pass Approch</h2>

<p>The key idea to have a reasonalbe effiency to get some idea of what you need. Including to see if you need to read certain paper, and to improve the effciency to read this paper.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="first-round">First Round</h3>

<p>First Round is just to have a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the paper, after that you shouldn&rsquo;t have any detail but have an idea of what they are going to do. This Round takes around <strong>5-10 minutes</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="goal">Goal</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s five question to answer after the first round, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Category</strong>: what type of paper is this? measurement paper; analysis of a system; a new research prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong>: what theorie is based on, what other paper is it related to?</li>
<li><strong>Correctness</strong>: are the assumption correct?</li>
<li><strong>Contributions</strong>: What are the main contribution of this paper?</li>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Is this paper well written.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s recommendated to go first round like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the title, abstract and introduction.</li>
<li>Read the title of section and sub-section.</li>
<li>Glance at the mathematical content to determind the underlying theoretical foundations.</li>
<li>Read the conclusion</li>
<li>Glance over the references,mentally ticking off the ones which has been read.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="second-round">Second Round</h3>

<p>This round helps you to jot down key points but ingore details such as proofs. It&rsquo;s necessary to note down the terms you didn&rsquo;t understand and questoins you have. It takes up to <strong>1 Hour</strong> for experienced readers.</p>

<h4 id="goal-1">Goal</h4>

<p>After the second round you should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper with supporting evidence. That being say, You should be able explain this paper to someone else all the key points.</p>

<h4 id="keep-in-mind">Keep in mind</h4>

<ol>
<li>Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and all other illustrations in the paper. Is all the detail of these graphs well made (such as axes properly labeled)? This helps you to separate from bad, ruhsed paper and excellents.</li>
<li>Remember to mark relevant unread references for futher reading.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="third-round">Third Round</h3>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: virtually re-implement the paper. You should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its stron gand weak points.</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong>:Make the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. It can take many hours for beginners and more than an hour or two for experienced reader.</p>

<p>By re-creation with actual paper, you can find the innovations of this paper, and also hidden failings and assumptions.</p>

<p>Third pass needs very much attention to the details, you need to identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.</p>

<h2 id="doing-a-literature-survey">Doing a Literature Survey</h2>

<p>Literature survey means you need to read a lot of papers, possibly unfamiliar field.</p>

<p><strong>Central Questions</strong>: What papers should you read?</p>

<p><strong>Fisrt</strong>: use academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer with some well-chosen keywords to find around <strong>3-5 recent highly-cited</strong> papers in that area. Do First Round on them, and see the section &ldquo;Related Work&rdquo;. You can find a thumbnail summary of the recent work. (Sometimes the Related Work points to a Survey paper, if you found that, you&rsquo;re done)</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>: find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. There are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they&rsquo;ve published recently. (That will help you identify the top conferences in that field)</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>: go to the webiste for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, consitute the first version of your survey. Make &ldquo;two Round&rdquo; on them, if they cite a key paper which you haven&rsquo;t found, add it and read it.</p>

<h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>

<p>If you are readin a paper to do a review, you should also read Timothy Roscoe&rsquo; paper on &ldquo;Writing reviews for syste,s conferences&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re planning to write a technical paper, you should refer both to Henning Schulzrinne&rsquo;s comprehensive web site and George Whitesides&rsquo;s excellent overview of the process. Finally, Simon Peyton Jones has a website that covers the enetire spectrum of research skills.</p>

<p>Iain H.McLean of Psychology, Inc. has put together a downloadable &lsquo;review matrix&rsquo; that simplifies paper reviewing using the &ldquo;Three-Round&rdquo; approach for papers in experimental psychology, which can probably be used, with minor  modifications, for papers in other areas.</p>
